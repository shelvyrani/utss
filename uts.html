        <h2 id="#1">Introduction</h2>
        <p id="bold">Strawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-studded.
            They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus
            Fragaria of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed
            foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.
            
            They are the most famous and trendiest fruits in the planet (Roger). There
            are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel;
            all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow
            seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and stalk that
            embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is picture of the strawberry fruit.</p>

        <h2 id="#2">Detailed History</h2>
        <p>The word strawberry is coined from "strewn" berries about the plants and
            thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They are
            not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant
            The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There
            are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are
            non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium
            (Roger)</p>
        <p>Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,
            stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries
            were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,
            and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is
            at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very
            well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).</p>

        <h2 id="#3">Various Uses of Strawberries</h2>

            strawberries is being used as recipe or an ingredient in preparation of
            drinks, meals or snacks. Strawberries are used as ingredients in many
            types of foods like cakes, yoghurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals and
